            <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
            <p>‎ </p>
            As they delved deeper into the forest, the trio found themselves facing an unrelenting onslaught of monsters. Haruki's heart raced in tandem with the fierce determination he saw in Seraphina and Garrick's eyes. The dense trees towered overhead, casting long, foreboding shadows, but they pressed on.
            <p>‎ </p>
            Finally, they emerged from the woods, met by the sprawling expanse of the Eldoria Empire on the horizon. Haruki's breath caught at the sight, the grandeur even more magnificent than Garrick had described. Seraphina and Garrick, wearied from their battles, leaned on each other for support. Elara, attuned to their fatigue, extended her hands in a gentle incantation, bathing them in a healing light.
            <p>‎ </p>
            "Thank you, Lady Elara," Garrick murmured, wiping sweat from his brow. "Those creatures... they took a toll, even on Seraphina and me."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Elara's smile was warm. "And you, Haruki? Did you find it enlightening, watching us face those foes? Perhaps you gleaned some techniques?"
            <p>‎ </p>
            "It was awe-inspiring!" Haruki declared. "I learned much, though I'm aware of my inexperience."
            <p>‎ </p>
            "If it meets with His Majesty's approval, I would gladly take you under my wing, guiding you in what I know," Garrick offered.
            <p>‎ </p>
            After a while, they arrived at the Northern Gate of Eldoria, where the guards greeted Seraphina, Elara, and Garrick by name. Curious gazes turned to Haruki, prompting Seraphina to explain his summoning and vouch for his trustworthiness. The guard hurried off to report their arrival to the King, leaving Haruki standing in wonder before the Empire's splendor.
            <p>‎ </p>
            They embarked on a tour of the Empire, revealing its intricate tapestry of homes, shops, and bustling districts. Finally, they reached the towering edifice of the SteelFury Guild House.
            <p>‎ </p>
            "Welcome to the SteelFury Guild House, Haruki," Seraphina announced. "Within these walls, you'll encounter formidable, astute adventurers. You can even forge your own alliance, a key to finding steadfast comrades. And worry not about rival groups - many are known to be amicable."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Haruki's eyes widened at the Guild House's vastness, an emblem of the guild's expanding membership. Seraphina shared glimpses of its storied past, heightening its significance.
            <p>‎ </p>
            Stepping inside, they were met by a gracious woman at the counter, Aria, responsible for enrolling new adventurers.
            <p>‎ </p>
            "Greetings, Lady Seraphina, Lady Elara, and Sir Garrick! How may I be of service today?" Aria beamed.
            <p>‎ </p>
            Seraphina introduced Haruki and explained his origin. She requested Aria's aid in Haruki's guild registration.
            <p>‎ </p>
            "Of course, Lady Seraphina. Pleasure to meet you, Haruki. I'm Aria Hayayumi, a Half-Elf. Today, I'll be your guide," Aria greeted Haruki warmly.
            <p>‎ </p>
            While they conversed, a guard from the gate approached, informing Seraphina, Elara, and Garrick of an urgent summons by His Majesty. They bid farewell to Haruki, hastening towards the castle.
            <p>‎ </p>
            Aria handed Haruki a guild identification card, used for recognition when journeying to other empires. Though it bore a cost of 5 gold coins, Haruki was exempted, courtesy of Seraphina's escort.
            <p>‎ </p>
            "To complete your registration, simply inscribe your name and press your thumb below your portrait. We'll capture your likeness, and you'll be set," Aria instructed, guiding Haruki through the process.
            <p>‎ </p>
            Grateful for the kind assistance, Haruki followed Aria's guidance. As his name met the parchment and his thumb met the card, he knew he was in capable hands with the guild.
            <p>‎ </p>
            Aria led him to a room where Kilin Kreilun, a dwarf photographer, awaited. Haruki couldn't help but wonder about the spellwork, dismissing any notion of cameras in this era.
            <p>‎ </p>
            Aria introduced Haruki, Kilin verifying the card before positioning Haruki before a blank canvas. Kilin crafted a mimicry of a camera, aligning his gaze, transferring Haruki's image onto the card.
            <p>‎ </p>
            Amazement filled Haruki's eyes. He queried Kilin about the spell, speculating its military application. Kilin affirmed his past as an army captain, now leading a simple life. Haruki thanked Kilin, adding a fond "Captain Kilin."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Laughter echoed, Aria and Kilin retreating to the counter to discuss further matters.
            <p>‎ </p>
            "As a newcomer, must I undergo training to gauge my abilities?" Haruki inquired.
            <p>‎ </p>
            "Indeed. Concluding the newcomers' training is a prerequisite for embarking on quests. You commence at rank D, and progression hinges on completing a designated number of quests, regardless of their complexity. Additionally, adventurers like yourself can form groups, each possessing its own rank," Aria elucidated.
            <p>‎ </p>
            "Understood. Then, I'd like to undertake training, to embark on quests and perhaps even join a group in time."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Afterwards, Haruki requested a room to sleep in to prepare for the next day's training. Aria showed him the way, and Haruki set his suitcase aside before jumping straight into bed. The softness of the blankets enveloped him, offering a comforting embrace after the day's trials. As his eyes grew heavy, he couldn't help but marvel at the incredible journey he had begun.
