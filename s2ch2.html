            <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
            <p>‎ </p>
            Haruki suddenly found himself in a dark empty space. He couldn't see anything except the strange blue circle at his feet. As he looked around, he noticed that the circle was getting smaller and smaller, and he began to panic. Just when he thought he was going to be crushed, the circle disappeared, and he found himself in a strange place.
            <p>‎ </p>
            The surroundings were unlike anything he had ever seen before. The air was thick with unusual scents, and the colors were darker than anything he had ever seen. Haruki was confused and disoriented, but he tried to stay calm. Suddenly, a figure appeared before him, dressed in peculiar robes and holding a staff.
            <p>‎ </p>
            The figure spoke to Haruki in a language he didn't recognize, but somehow, he knew what the figure was saying. The figure introduced itself as a old wizard and explained that Haruki had been summoned to a magical realm to help solve a great problem. Haruki was skeptical at first, but as the wizard explained the situation, he began to realize that this was not a dream or hallucination.
            <p>‎ </p>
            Haruki knew he had to help the wizard and the people of this realm, even if it meant risking his own life. He took a deep breath, nodded to the wizard, and prepared himself for whatever lay ahead.
            <p>‎ </p>
            [To the world where he is brought]
            <p>‎ </p>
            Haruki found himself in a world of magic after being suddenly teleported. He stumbled upon landing, and as he got up, he noticed grass and flower petals stuck to his suit. Looking around, he realized he was in a vast field surrounded by trees at the distance. As he took a few steps, a voice suddenly spoke, asking him who he was. Haruki was startled and shouted back in confusion, but no one seemed to be around.
            <p>‎ </p>
            Two twin girls and a man in armor suddenly appeared before him, and Haruki found himself stepping back in fright. One of the girls, Seraphina Gazzelwald, introduced herself and tried to calm him down. Haruki was captivated by the striking sight of her snow-white hair, her captivating beauty, and eyes possessed a luminance reminiscent of precious white pearls, and eventually revealed his name, Kazanarugi Haruki, and was complimented on his name. The man in armor, Garrick Yoshisada, introduced himself, also Seraphina's sister, whose name is Elara, shared an identical visage, save for her shorter, stylishly cropped hair and a gaze that sparkled with a vivid shade of blue.
            <p>‎ </p>
            Haruki asked where he was, and Seraphina explained that he had been somewhat summoned to their planet, Nymphs. Haruki was devastated at the thought of leaving his own sister behind, but Seraphina suggested finding the caster who brought him here to ask if he could be sent back. When Haruki revealed he came from Earth, Seraphina and Garrick were surprised, and Seraphina kneeled down with respect, declaring that Haruki was the one who would save their world.
            <p>‎ </p>
            Haruki was baffled by the strange conversation that was unfolding before him. Seraphina had just revealed that they had summoned him from Earth to fight the God of War, but Haruki couldn't believe that he, an ordinary person, could possibly be of any use in such a battle.
            <p>‎ </p>
            However, Garrick chimed in, saying that anyone who was summoned from Earth would gain special powers. Haruki was even more confused. Why would someone like him have powers?
            <p>‎ </p>
            To clear up the confusion, Garrick suggested that Seraphina must check him to see if he had any powers. Then her eyes glowed yellow as she examined him, confirming that he did indeed have incredible strength resting within him. Haruki was both surprised and a little disturbed by this revelation.
            <p>‎ </p>
            Garrick then asked Haruki to try using his powers by holding out his hand and imagining a fragment of his power coming out. Haruki followed the instructions, and a fraction of a second later, a minuscule lightning bolt crackled forth from his hand, spanning just a few millimeters. To his amazement, Haruki was unharmed by the experience.
            <p>‎ </p>
            As Haruki inquired about the strange occurrence, Seraphina clarified that he did possess extraordinary abilities. However, she emphasized that mastering them would demand rigorous training. Without proper control, the potential for harm extended not only to himself, but also to those in his vicinity, possibly resulting in dire consequences.
            <p>‎ </p>
            Haruki was left reeling from the realization that he had been summoned to fight a "God" and that he possessed powers that he didn't fully understand. Nevertheless, he knew that he had a role to play in the coming battle and that he would need to train hard to control his newfound abilities.
