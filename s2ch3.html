            <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
            <p>‎ </p>
            As they strolled across the vast field, Haruki's brows knit together, worry etching his features. "Can I really control my powers, Seraphina-san?" he asked, his voice tinged with uncertainty.
            <p>‎ </p>
            Garrick's sharp instincts picked up on Haruki's comment, sensing a dismissive tone towards Seraphina. He subtly leaned in, suggesting that Haruki should offer her the respect of using her proper title. However, Seraphina, with a casual wave, assured Haruki that he could address her just by her name. This marked the first occasion she'd been addressed so informally, yet it didn't faze her in the least.
            <p>‎ </p>
            Garrick, ever the vigilant companion, listened intently as Seraphina answered Haruki's question. "Yes, you can. Once we reach the Eldoria Empire, maybe we can begin training you in basic magic and spells," she replied.
            <p>‎ </p>
            Curious about their destination, Haruki turned to Seraphina, his eyes wide with intrigue. She explained that they were headed to the Eldoria Empire, through the looming forest ahead. Her voice held a note of caution as she warned of the lurking monsters within. Elara, her grip on Seraphina's hand firm, nodded in agreement, signaling their collective determination to press on.
            <p>‎ </p>
            While they walked, Haruki couldn't help but ask Garrick about Seraphina's swift trust. "Lady Seraphina probed your thoughts," Garrick disclosed, his tone matter-of-fact. Haruki's eyes widened, wondering if Seraphina had delved into every corner of his mind.
            <p>‎ </p>
            "You mean--"
            <p>‎ </p>
            Before he could finish his thought, Garrick cut in, "Mean what?" He clarified that Seraphina had only sought to ascertain if Haruki, or any other person could be trusted, by just determining the balance of positive and negative thoughts
            <p>‎ </p>
            Haruki breathed a sigh of relief, grateful that Seraphina hadn't invaded his entire mind. *hehe* They continued their journey until they reached the forest's entrance. There, Seraphina and Garrick offered a somber warning about the dangers within. It was a place teeming with various monsters, deemed too perilous for humans. Haruki swallowed hard, mentally steeling himself for what lay ahead. Elara's hand clung tightly to Seraphina's, and they ventured into the forest, the open field fading from view.
            <p>‎ </p>
            Deep within the woods, a menacing pack of wolves encircled them. The alpha, marked by two white scars across its left eye, indicating blindness, signaled by howling an imminent assault. Then a wolf lunged at Seraphina from behind, but Garrick leapt forward, intercepting the attack. "Get down, Haruki!" he barked, prompting Haruki to seek cover. In the blink of an eye, Seraphina conjured a blazing fireball, sending it hurtling towards a stealthy wolf.
            <p>‎ </p>
            As they defended themselves, another wolf crept up behind, growling menacingly. It leaped towards Haruki, and targeting Seraphina. Despite Haruki's warning, it was too late. His instincts took over, his hand thrusting out as a huge bolt of lightning surged forth. The wolf was hit and convulsed, smoke billowing around it, but Haruki got knocked back in a short distance because of his magic. Still, Haruki stood, surprised but unharmed. The group stared in astonishment, Haruki's gaze meeting the leader of the pack. Once more, he focused his energy, summoning another lightning strike that left the alpha wolf unconscious.
            <p>‎ </p>
            Witnessing their leader's fall, the pack scattered, dragging their incapacitated comrades away, disappearing into the shadows.
            <p>‎ </p>
            As Seraphina and Garrick dealt with the remaining wolves, the wolved crumbled into fine dust.
            <p>‎ </p>
            Haruki couldn't help but wonder if the dust posed a threat. Seraphina reassured him, explaining that it held magical properties, capable of fortifying their strength.
            <p>‎ </p>
            "When you defeat creatures like these wolves, they transform into magic dust, which you can absorb to enhance your abilities," she elucidated. "The quantity depends on the creature's strength. However, you can't obtain magic dust from humans or demi-humans, such as elves or dwarves."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Seraphina and Garrick, claimed their share of the dust, feeling a palpable surge of power. Garrick noted that even small amounts could contribute to one's strength, cautioning against greed in the pursuit of larger quantities. He suggested a method to acquire more: letting forest inhabitants, those less inclined to combat, give chase rather than harming them.
            <p>‎ </p>
            "If you're seeking more magic dust, this forest is the perfect source," Garrick advised. "Just be mindful of the non-combat creatures and let the hunters come after them." The decision, however, rested with them.
            <p>‎ </p>
            Exerting himself took a toll on Haruki, and he began to drift towards unconsciousness. Garrick acted swiftly, catching him just in time. "You've done well, Haruki. Rest for now; you've expended too much energy," Garrick counselled, and with that, Haruki closed his eyes and succumbed to slumber.
            <p>‎ </p>
            As the hours passed, Haruki's senses slowly returned, finding himself cradled in the protection of Seraphina's lap, while Elara maintained her vigilant watch for potential dangers. As he completely woke up, his eyes inadvertently caught the contours of Seraphina's two medium mountains, and he felt a sudden warmth of embarrassment flooding his cheeks.
            <p>‎ </p>
            Seraphina detected Haruki's awakening, noting the crimson hue that now graced his face. "Ah, you're finally rousing. Why the rosy complexion?" she inquired. In response, he swiftly straightened, stammering, "Oh, it's, uh... nothing, heh." A nervous laugh escaped from him, the flush not yet receded. Haruki's mind briefly wandered to thoughts of Seraphina's endearing cuteness and innocence, but he swiftly snapped himself out of it. He gave himself a brisk, self-administered wake-up call, eliciting a startled reaction from Seraphina, before returning to his usual demeanor.
            <p>‎ </p>
            He sought out Garrick, who stood sentinel over them. "You've pushed yourself too hard, Haruki. We must return to the empire swiftly; the sun is setting," Garrick informed him.
            <p>‎ </p>
            Navigating through the forest proved easier, as monsters hastily retreated at the sight of Haruki. Finally, they emerged from the trees, and the northern gate of the empire is within sight. Anticipation bubbled within Haruki; he couldn't wait to lay eyes on the city.        </section>
