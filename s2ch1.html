            <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
            <p>‎ </p>
            Haruki Kazanarugi moved through the monotonous rhythm of Earth, a stalwart figure in the bustling Japanese company where he served as an Office Assistant. Each day, he poured himself into his work for his family's well-being that drives him tirelessly forward.
            <p>‎ </p>
            One evening, amidst laughter and clinking glasses, Haruki found himself in a cozy bar with his coworkers. The night wore on, the magic of alcohol weaving its spell. By 10 pm, their spirits soared.
            <p>‎ </p>
            As the bar's closing announcement rang out, they stumbled onto the streets, making their way to Haruki's apartment. One friend faltered, supported by the others. At Haruki's apartment, they offered their help up the stairs, but he insisted on tackling them alone, though they lingered close, watchful.
            <p>‎ </p>
            Haruki ascended the stairs, each step steady, reaching his second-floor apartment. Unlocking the door, he entered the dimly lit space. There, on the couch, Mei, his sister slumbered.
            <p>‎ </p>
            He gently roused her, urging her to retire to her own room. Groggily, Mei greeted him, but her disappointment palpable as the scent of alcohol hung in the air. She reminded him of a forgotten promise, a promise of food. Guilt weighed on Haruki, and he vowed to make it up to her the next day.
            <p>‎ </p>
            With her pillow in tow, Mei retreated to her room. Haruki, too, withdrew to his own sanctuary, shedding his work attire. Settled in front of his laptop, he became engrossed in a report. The rhythmic clatter of keys filled the room until the embrace of slumber finally overcame him.
            <p>‎ </p>
            Little did Haruki know, as sleep claimed him, that the tides of his life were poised for a seismic shift.
            <p>‎ </p>
            <i>[Next Morning]</i>
            <p>‎ </p>
            Haruki's awakening was abrupt, the shrill cry of his alarm jolting him from slumber. A swift flick of a switch silenced it, and he rubbed his eyes, seeking wakefulness. As he rose, Mei's voice called out, announcing breakfast was ready. Haruki greeted her and made his way to the bathroom, washing away the remnants of sleep.
            <p>‎ </p>
            Emerging, Haruki donned only his shirt, mindful of keeping his clean clothes pristine. The black suit and long white sleeves remained untouched. In the kitchen, Mei had set out their breakfast, conversation flowing as they shared the meal.
            <p>‎ </p>
            Post-breakfast, Haruki adorned himself in the long white sleeves, and Mei prepared a bento box for his lunch. Settling on the couch, he powered on the TV, multitasking with his laptop, absorbed in his report. Time went by, and it wasn't long before he realized he was behind schedule. With haste, he gathered his belongings and bid Mei farewell.
            <p>‎ </p>
            Dashing towards the office, Haruki's footsteps echoed with urgency, yet he was already three minutes tardy. In his frenzy, he noticed an odd blue circle beneath his feet, cryptic symbols etched upon it. Surprised, he sought help from passersby, pointing out the anomaly, but they merely regarded him with suspicion, distancing themselves.
            <p>‎ </p>
            Arriving at the office building, he hastened to don his black suit. In his rush, the strange blue circle reappeared, larger and brighter. Onlookers gaped, some reaching for their phones to capture the bizarre sight. Fear held Haruki captive, rendering him immobile.
            <p>‎ </p>
            The circle enveloped him, and in an instant, Haruki vanished, leaving no trace. Those who witnessed it were left in stunned disbelief, reaching for their phones to summon the authorities. Yet, there was no explanation, no rational account for what had transpired.
