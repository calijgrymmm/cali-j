            <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
            <p>‎ </p>
            Under the morning sun, Aria led Haruki through the sprawling expanse of the training grounds. Kilin, a weathered veteran with a past in the Elodia Empire's army, stood tall amidst a gathering of fresh-faced recruits, among them, the confident Garrick. His voice carried weight as he unraveled the crucial attributes necessary for effective combat.
            <p>‎ </p>
            As Kilin spoke, a chorus of resolute affirmations echoed through the ranks, "Yes, sir!"
            <p>‎ </p>
            The training commenced in carefully orchestrated stages. The first challenge demanded nimbleness, with a course of logs to dodge and maneuver, all under the unforgiving constraint of time. The second phase upped the ante, weaving traps and whizzing arrows into the mix. The third leg of the trial thrust them into the midst of fearsome monsters, offering a taste of the true perils they would face. The final stage pitted guild members against each other, wielding practice weapons—blunted replicas of their lethal counterparts. Success here meant progression, but failure was not the end; another opportunity would arise.
            <p>‎ </p>
            Anticipation hummed through the air as they prepared for the initial hurdle. Some stumbled, their determination etched in every strained muscle. A brazen trainee cornered Haruki, taunting, "Move it, slowpoke! I'll be setting records here, while you all eat my dust!"
            <p>‎ </p>
            Haruki's response carried a measured warning, "Words can be fleeting. The true trial lies ahead. Speed isn't the only measure of skill."
            <p>‎ </p>
            The trainee sneered, brushing off the advice. "I've aced this before. No doubt I'll do it again."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Undaunted, Haruki pressed on, but an ill-judged leap over the logs led to a humbling tumble. Laughter and jeers followed, each barb delivered with a cutting edge. "That's what you get for overestimating yourself!"
            <p>‎ </p>
            Kilin's presence sliced through the tension, his voice a stern rebuke. "Enough, both of you. Roderick, remember your own missteps before boasting. Focus on the task at hand."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Under Kilin's watchful eye, Haruki regained his composure, steadily navigating the course. As he neared the finish line, Roderick couldn't resist one final taunt, savoring the perceived triumph.
            <p>‎ </p>
            Kilin's figure loomed, reprimanding them both. "That's it. No more distractions. Prepare for the training. Everyone, to the start!"
            <p>‎ </p>
            Silenced by the weight of authority, Haruki and Roderick fell in line with their comrades, ready to face the formidable trials that awaited.
