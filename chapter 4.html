            <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
            <p>‎ </p>
            [In the quiet and hushed atmosphere of the origin chamber, the group pores over the contents of the ancient tome they discovered. As they turn each page, a sense of anticipation and urgency fills the air. Their eyes widen as they stumble upon a fragile piece of ancient paper, covered in text that seems to be written in a script they can't immediately decipher.]
            <p>‎ </p>
            Professor Leonhardt: [examining the paper] "This... It appears to be a letter or a personal account. But the script is unlike any language I've encountered before."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Ethan: [leaning in] "It's almost as if the text is intentionally obfuscated."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Lina: [squinting at the paper] "Could it be a code or a cipher?"
            <p>‎ </p>
            Zara: [analyzing the characters] "I don't recognize any patterns. It's as if the words are deliberately blurred."
            <p>‎ </p>
            [The group exchanges puzzled glances, wondering about the significance of this mysterious piece of paper.]
            <p>‎ </p>
            Ethan: [curious] "Could this be the original hostess' account of her experience with the power?"
            <p>‎ </p>
            Professor Leonhardt: [nodding] "It's possible. Perhaps she had to obscure her story to protect the knowledge from falling into the wrong hands."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Lina: [thoughtful] "If the power came with consequences, maybe her story contains a warning or a lesson for future generations."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Zara: [pointing at the paper] "Look at this symbol here. It's repeated throughout the text."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Professor Leonhardt: "It's consistent with the ancient symbols associated with the Penta-Star. This could be a key to deciphering the text."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Ethan: [determined] "Let's see if we can decode it. This might hold the key to understanding the nature of the power and the challenges that come with it."
            <p>‎ </p>
            [With renewed resolve, the group begins to painstakingly analyze the text, focusing on the recurring symbols and attempting to decipher their meanings. As they work together, their efforts gradually reveal a hidden narrative—a tale of struggle, sacrifice, and unbearable pain experienced by the original hostess as she wielded the power of the Penta-Star.]
            <p>‎ </p>
            Professor Leonhardt: [reading aloud] "The power surged through me, reshaping reality itself. But with each act of creation, the pain deepened, as if the fabric of existence itself recoiled."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Lina: [looking concerned] "She's describing an incredible burden... a pain that accompanied her use of the power."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Zara: [reading further] "It was as if the power demanded payment, a toll in suffering for every act of creation."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Ethan: [grimacing] "So, the power wasn't just a gift. It came with a heavy price."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Professor Leonhardt: [closing the book] "The original hostess endured immense suffering to wield the power. Her experience serves as a stark reminder of the consequences that come with such extraordinary abilities."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Lina: [softening her expression] "It seems that the power's ability to reshape the world comes at the cost of the reshaper's own well-being."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Zara: [looking contemplative] "And now we have to decide whether to continue our pursuit of this power, knowing what we've learned."
            <p>‎ </p>
            [Ethan, Lina, and Zara exchange somber glances, the weight of their decisions hanging heavily in the air. The scene fades as they reflect on the hostess' story and the implications it holds for their own journey. Ethan's curiosity is piqued by the enigmatic ring that adorned the statue of the original hostess. With a sense of determination, he carefully removes the ring from the statue's finger. The moment his fingers close around the dark, glowing ring, a subtle change seems to ripple through the chamber.]
            <p>‎ </p>
            Ethan: [whispering to himself] "What happens if I..."
            <p>‎ </p>
            [Before he can finish his thought, the group watches as Ethan extends the ring towards them, one by one. However, as each person takes the ring, its luminous glow gradually dims until it fades entirely.]
            <p>‎ </p>
            Lina: [perplexed] "The light... It's gone when I hold it."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Zara: [confused] "Same here. The ring loses its glow as soon as I touch it."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Professor Leonhardt: [stroking his beard] "It seems the ring's light extinguishes for each of us except for you, Ethan."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Ethan: [bewildered] "But why? What could make me different?"
            <p>‎ </p>
            Lina: [looking at the ring] "Maybe it's connected to the power itself, and it recognizes you as the potential host."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Zara: [thinking aloud] "Or it could be attuned to your mana, Ethan. You're the one who felt a connection to the original hostess."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Professor Leonhardt: "The ring's response to you might indicate that you possess the necessary qualities to potentially wield the power."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Ethan: [holding the ring up] "It's both fascinating and unsettling... Why me?"
            <p>‎ </p>
            Lina: [softly] "It might be that your connection to the Penta-Star is stronger than you realize."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Zara: [smiling] "Whatever the reason, it's a sign that our journey has brought us closer to uncovering the truth."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Professor Leonhardt: "Indeed. The ring may hold a key to unlocking the power, but it also serves as a reminder of the choices and responsibilities that come with it."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Ethan: [gazing at the ring] "I can't help but wonder about the original hostess, the one who bore this burden."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Lina: [placing a hand on his shoulder] "We'll honor her memory by making wise decisions with the knowledge we've gained."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Zara: [determined] "And we'll be prepared for whatever lies ahead."
            <p>‎ </p>
            [As the group gathers around Ethan and the ring, a sense of unity and purpose envelops them. The scene transitions, leaving them to contemplate the ring's significance and the path they must tread.]
