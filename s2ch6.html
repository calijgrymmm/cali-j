            <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
            <p>‎ </p>
            Under the azure sky, the participants of the Elodia Empire's grueling competition gathered at the starting line, anticipation thick in the air. Haruki, a focused and determined contender, recalled Kilin's instructions, his mind a well-mapped blueprint of the upcoming challenge. Roderick, on the other hand, brimming with overconfidence, couldn't resist taunting his competition.
            <p>‎ </p>
            "Hey! You're ignoring me, Talk to me you little trash!"
            <p>‎ </p>
            As Kilin began the countdown, Roderick's arrogance proved his downfall. Distracted by his heated exchange with Haruki, he missed the crucial moment, and the race was underway.
            <p>‎ </p>
            Legs pumping, bodies weaving through the obstacles, Haruki surged ahead. He moved with grace, dodging logs, sprinting, and effortlessly maneuvering beneath them. Roderick, fueled by determination, closed the gap, the race becoming a neck-and-neck struggle.
            <p>‎ </p>
            "I'm right behind you! I'm gonna pass you!"
            <p>‎ </p>
            Roderick's declaration hung in the air, but it was short-lived. A slippery log sent him crashing into the water, leaving Haruki and the others to surge ahead. Haruki crossed the finish line first, his victory secured.
            <p>‎ </p>
            As time trickled by, Roderick finally slogged through, soaked and frustrated. Haruki, extending a towel, offered a small act of kindness met with resentment.
            <p>‎ </p>
            "Thank you for that. But I don't need your concern."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Haruki's voice was steady, his gaze unwavering. "Try to calm yourself and focus on the stage more than your mouth, Roderick."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Confused, Roderick sought clarification. "Huh? What did you say?"
            <p>‎ </p>
            "A tip from a newcomer, just so you can't lose this test and your attitude."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Silenced by Haruki's words, Roderick absorbed the lesson. Kilin's announcement of the second stage's warm-up provided a welcome diversion.
            <p>‎ </p>
            As they prepared for the next challenge, Roderick approached Haruki with gratitude and a sincere apology.
            <p>‎ </p>
            "Th- Thank you, maybe I just got carried away, Sorry. I will try to calm myself down just as you said."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Haruki's response was warm, extending an olive branch of friendship. "You really need to. Being carried away and act like you know anything, doesn't end up as you expect. The name's Haruki, Haruki Kazanarugi, I just signed up from the guild."
            <p>‎ </p>
            "Roderick Isao, I signed yesterday and failed the training. Nice to meet you Haruki. Can we be friends? I haven't had one since I came here."
            <p>‎ </p>
            "So, in other words, you're also new here? at the Elodia Empire?"
            <p>‎ </p>
            "Yes, I have been roaming around the world selling items, since then, I changed my mind and try to live in a place where I can enjoy the rest of my life."
            <p>‎ </p>
            "Ohh, I see. I agree to becoming your friend, Roderick."
            <p>‎ </p>
            They proceeded to the second stage, where Roderick absorbed Haruki's advice. He moved with newfound calmness, navigating arrows and traps. When an unfortunate slip threatened to repeat history, Haruki's quick reflexes saved the day.
            <p>‎ </p>
            "Thanks for saving me, Haruki. I did not expect that I slipped again like last time."
            <p>‎ </p>
            "Not a problem. It's very normal to make mistakes, just don't repeat it over and over again. You still need a little more ... footwork and focus to work out."
            <p>‎ </p>
            "True, I still have more ways to go, to be calmer and more focused. Can I get a tip from you? To be much calmer like you do?"
            <p>‎ </p>
            "Sure, I just have to clear my mind and ignore distraction. In that way, I finished my work in my office always."
            <p>‎ </p>
            "Office? A workplace? You work somewhere here?"
            <p>‎ </p>
            "Oh... About that, I was not originally here, I lived on another world, I just got somehow summoned here."
            <p>‎ </p>
            "I see, Thanks for the tip, Haruki. I'll try to clear my mind as you said."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Again, Everyone lined up and waited for Kilin's command.
