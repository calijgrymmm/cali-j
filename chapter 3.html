            <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
            <p>‎ </p>
            [With bated breath, the group continues to absorb the revelations contained within the ancient book, their understanding of the Penta-Star's power deepening with every turn of the page. As Professor Leonhardt reads aloud, the words seem to hold both awe and apprehension.]
            <p>‎ </p>
            Professor Leonhardt: [reading intently] "To acquire the power of the Penta-Star, one must be a vessel with a mana capacity of 10 to the power of million. The power is of such magnitude that it requires an individual of unparalleled mana reserves, for any lesser vessel will be unable to contain its essence."
            <p>‎ </p>
            [Ethan, Lina, and Zara exchange glances, their expressions a mixture of amazement and astonishment.]
            <p>‎ </p>
            Ethan: [whispering] "10 to the power of million... That's an unimaginable amount of mana."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Professor Leonhardt: [continuing] "In the pages that follow, the book depicts an illustration—a woman kneeling upon a god. She was the original host of this power, possessing a mana capacity second only to that of a deity."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Zara: [in awe] "So, this woman was incredibly powerful, almost on par with a god?"
            <p>‎ </p>
            Lina: [nodding] "And she was the one who held the power of the Penta-Star."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Professor Leonhardt: "Indeed. Her ability to contain such immense mana was a testament to her exceptional strength and connection to the spiritual realm."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Ethan: [thinking aloud] "So, whoever seeks to acquire this power must possess a mana capacity equal to that of the original host?"
            <p>‎ </p>
            Professor Leonhardt: "It appears so. The power's potency necessitates a host with a unique constitution—a being who can harness and control mana on an unprecedented scale."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Zara: [pondering] "But does that mean that only a select few individuals could even attempt to wield this power?"
            <p>‎ </p>
            Professor Leonhardt: "It seems that way, Zara. The criteria for being a viable host are incredibly stringent. But remember, even if someone met the mana requirement, they must also understand the consequences and responsibilities attached to this power."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Lina: [gazing at the picture] "The original host must have faced immense challenges, both internal and external."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Professor Leonhardt: [closing the book] "Indeed, Lina. Acquiring such power is not just about raw capacity but also about the strength of character and the ability to bear the weight of the world's destiny."
            <p>‎ </p>
            [Ethan, Lina, and Zara exchange solemn looks, realizing the enormity of the task before them. The scene fades as they reflect on the revelations and prepare to make decisions that could reshape their world. After a year of relentless pursuit, the group's journey finally leads them to the fabled origin of the Penta-Star. The atmosphere is charged with anticipation and a sense of culmination as they stand before a majestic statue—a representation of the original hostess of the power.]
            <p>‎ </p>
            Professor Leonhardt: [in awe] "Behold, my friends. We stand at the very heart of the enigma—the place where the power of the Penta-Star is said to have originated."
            <p>‎ </p>
            [The statue of the original hostess is grand and intricate, capturing her likeness in exquisite detail. A dark ring adorns her ring finger, catching the light in an otherworldly glow.]
            <p>‎ </p>
            Ethan: [softly] "The original hostess... She must have been an extraordinary person."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Lina: [curious] "And that ring on her finger... It seems significant."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Zara: [stepping closer] "Let's examine it. There might be clues about how to interact with it."
            <p>‎ </p>
            [Ethan steps forward and gently touches the ring on the statue's finger. As his fingers make contact, the ring begins to emit a soft, pulsating light. The light spreads through the statue, illuminating its intricate details and casting an otherworldly aura around them.]
            <p>‎ </p>
            Professor Leonhardt: [astonished] "Remarkable! It seems the ring is responding to Ethan's touch."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Ethan: [entranced] "I can feel a connection... as if it's drawing on some kind of energy."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Lina: [watching in awe] "Could it be unlocking something?"
            <p>‎ </p>
            Zara: [excited] "Let's see if there's more to discover."
            <p>‎ </p>
            [Suddenly, the statue emits a low, resonating hum, and the ground beneath them begins to tremble gently. A hidden compartment beneath the statue's base starts to open, revealing an ornate, ancient-looking book.]
            <p>‎ </p>
            Professor Leonhardt: [voice filled with wonder] "An ancient tome... It seems we've uncovered another layer of this mystery."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Ethan: [slowly taking the book] "This must hold even more insights about the power and its origins."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Lina: [smiling] "Our journey isn't over yet. There's still so much to learn."
            <p>‎ </p>
            Zara: [nodding] "And so much to consider."
            <p>‎ </p>
            [As the group gathers around the book, their excitement and determination remain undiminished. The scene transitions as they prepare to delve into the contents of the ancient tome, ready to unveil the next chapter of the enigma that has captivated them for so long.]
